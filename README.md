Once upon a midnight dreary,
As I wrote some code, weak and weary,
I nodded off, my thoughts unsteady,
And dreamed of syntax, dark and heady.

Suddenly, a sound, a tapping sound,
I awoke, my heart began to pound,
A message from the compiler grim,
A warning of some fatal sin.

I searched my code, line by line,
Desperate to find the dreaded sign,
A misplaced bracket, a typo found,
A careless error that did abound.

But still the message did persist,
No matter how much I dismissed,
A problem deep within the code,
A mystery that would not be slowed.

So I delved into the code's abyss,
Determined to find and fix,
The bug that had eluded me,
And restore my program to clarity.

And as I worked with frantic pace,
I felt the tension start to race,
For every line that I revised,
I feared the error would yet survive.

But finally, a breakthrough made,
The issue found, the bug displayed,
And with a sigh of great relief,
I compiled, ran, and found no grief.

So if you find yourself in a plight,
With code that gives you such a fright,
Take heart, and persevere my friend,
For in the end, the code will mend.
